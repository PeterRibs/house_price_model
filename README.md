# House price model

Using real data from Boston House Prices Dataset (More detal in `https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html`). The question was answered using separate files. The graphs produced in order to answer the question are in the 'Graphs' folder or 'https://peterribs.github.io/house_price_model/'. The names of the figures are as 'FIG_'+'name of the file that gave origin'.

There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:
- CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
- ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

- CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT - % lower status of the population
- MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
